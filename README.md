# CF-Application-for-kids

Cystic Fibrosis does not allow kids to lead normal lives due to the time sensitive and continuous medication and therapies required to control the effects of CF.
Many medication doses and therapies are missed/skipped due to the patients not wanting to stop from being normal kids and that most therpies are time consuming and 
unejoyable. 

This application hopes to engage kids more in their treatment; to not only understand their medications and therapies but also remind and enagge them in their therpaies.
